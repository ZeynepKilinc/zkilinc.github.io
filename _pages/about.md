Hello There! I am a senior undergraduate student, doing double major in Molecular Biology & Genetics and Computer Science at SabancÄ± University with a minor in Chemistry. Here, you can find my academic background, my journey in science, and some of my favorite stories from my hobbies...

Throughout my undergraduate studies I have focused on discovering the subjects that motivates me the most. My training in bioinformatics and computational biology equipped me with broad research experience across a variety of topics. 

Thanks to the opportunities offered by my professors, with their encouragements and patience, I have learned how to work systematically in a reseach project, to cooperate with different teams, what to include in a well structured poster, key aspects to create the figures that represents my data efortlesly... It was a privilage to work with all my professors and my amazing lab mates.  

The website is still under construction, as of December 2022 only the publications page is completed. I am hoping to finish all the pages until mid January.
Thanks for visiting !!!
